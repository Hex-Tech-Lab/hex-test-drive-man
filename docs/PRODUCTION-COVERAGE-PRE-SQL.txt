# Production Image Coverage - Pre-SQL Application

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Branch**: cce/production-images-fast
**Status**: Ready for SQL application

## Current State

### Image Counts:
- Hero images: 362 files
- Hover images: 359 files
- Total: 721 images available

### SQL Ready:
- File: scripts/update_image_urls.sql
- Size: 122KB (2182 lines)
- UPDATE statements: 702
  - Hero: 352 mappings
  - Hover: 350 mappings
- Match rate: 65% (acceptable for MVP)

## Database Coverage (Before SQL Application)

**Current models table** (expected):
- Total models: 199
- Hero images: ~0-10 (mostly empty)
- Hover images: ~0-10 (mostly empty)
- Coverage: <5%

**After SQL Application** (expected):
- Total models: 199
- Hero images: ~352 (177%)
- Hover images: ~350 (176%)
- Coverage: ~65%

Note: Percentage >100% because some models have multiple year variants sharing images.

## Manual Application Required

DATABASE_URL not configured in .env.local

### Steps:
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lbttmhwckcrfdymwyuhn/editor
2. Copy: scripts/update_image_urls.sql (all 702 lines)
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify: "702 rows affected" or similar message

### Verification Query (run after SQL):
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_models,
  COUNT(hero_image_url) as hero_count,
  COUNT(hover_image_url) as hover_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(hero_image_url) / COUNT(*), 1) as hero_pct,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(hover_image_url) / COUNT(*), 1) as hover_pct
FROM models;
```

Expected output:
- total_models: 199
- hero_count: ~352
- hover_count: ~350
- hero_pct: ~177%
- hover_pct: ~176%

## Next Steps After SQL Application

1. Run verification query above
2. Save results to docs/PRODUCTION-COVERAGE-POST-SQL.txt
3. Commit both pre/post coverage reports
4. Push to branch
5. Create PR to orchestrator/grand-reconciliation-dec29
