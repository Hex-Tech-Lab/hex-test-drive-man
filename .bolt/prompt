For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, production-worthy, and follow Material Design 3 principles.

This project REQUIRES Material-UI (@mui/material) for all UI components. DO NOT use Tailwind CSS or Lucide icons. Use TSX only.

Stack requirements:
✅ Material-UI 6.1.9 for ALL components
✅ Emotion for styling (MUI's CSS-in-JS)
✅ Material Icons (@mui/icons-material)
✅ React 19.0.0, Next.js 15.1.3, TypeScript 5.7.2
✅ Zustand for state, SWR for data fetching, react-i18next for translations

DO NOT install Tailwind, Lucide, shadcn, or alternative UI libraries. Material-UI is mandatory for this project.
